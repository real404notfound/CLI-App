# CLI To-Do List App

This is a simple command line to-do list app created with Python. It allows you to add, remove, list, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are stored in a JSON file, so they persist when the app is run.

## Features:
- **View tasks**: Display all available tasks in the to-do list.
- **Add a task**: Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Remove a task**: Remove a task from the list.
- **Mark task as completed**: Mark a task as completed.
- **Clear completed tasks**: Clear all tasks that are completed.
- **Persistent storage**: All tasks are saved in a JSON file and persist between app restarts.
- **Console clearing**: The console is cleared after each action for a clean user interface.
